Current Programs:

Inverse Heat Optimization Problem in 0D (Homogenous Kappa). This program try and guess a materials original thermal conductivity (kappa) via Finite Element simulation through FEniCS. It then uses scipy.optimize to minimize the difference between original (measured) temperature distribution and the simulated temperature distribution.
